## 🔑 Authentication

Authentication is securely handled using **AWS Cognito**, which provides robust features for user sign-up, sign-in, and managing access control throughout the application.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Workflow

Our team adheres to a standard **fork-and-pull-request** workflow to maintain code quality and facilitate clean collaboration:

1.  **Fork** the repository to your personal GitHub account.
2.  **Create a feature branch** (e.g., `feat/add-dark-mode`) in your fork and commit your changes.
3.  **Push your branch** and open a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `main` branch of the upstream repository.
4.  Ensure **all merge conflicts are resolved** before requesting a review.
5.  A team member will review and approve the PR before it is merged into `main`.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites for Local Development

To develop or run RecipeGo locally, you must have the following dependencies:

* **Node.js** $\ge 18$
* **npm** $\ge 8$
* **Docker** $\ge 20$

### AWS Account Configuration

A properly configured AWS environment is required for full functionality:

* A configured **Cognito User Pool**.
* A dedicated **DynamoDB table** for recipe data.
* An **AWS Amplify** app configured (optional for basic local development).

## 🧽 Code Linting & Formatting

We use standard tooling to enforce high code quality and consistency.

| Command | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `npm run lint` | Checks code and style quality against defined rules (non-breaking during development). |
| `npm run format` | **Automatically fixes** common linting and formatting issues across the codebase. |

## 🌑 Dark Mode Support

This project natively supports Dark Mode styling. Ensuring a pleasant viewing experience in all lighting conditions.
